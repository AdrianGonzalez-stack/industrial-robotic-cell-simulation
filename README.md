# Industrial Robotic Cell Simulation

## Overview

This project presents the design, programming and full simulation of a dual-robot industrial workstation developed using ABB RobotStudio.

The system replicates a realistic manufacturing automation scenario including multi-robot coordination, automated tool exchange and structured production flow control.

The objective was to design a fully integrated robotic cell from a system engineering perspective, focusing on architecture, sequencing logic and industrial reliability.

## System Architecture

The workstation integrates:

- Dual industrial robot coordination
- Automated tool changing system
- Conveyor-based material handling
- Positioner interaction
- Phase-based operational sequencing
- Quality validation logic
- Smart Components control architecture
- Teach Pendant interaction

A structured control flow was developed to manage task allocation, conditional branching and production phase transitions within the cell.

## Robot Programming (RAPID)

All robotic operations and sequencing logic were programmed in **ABB RAPID**.

The implementation includes:

- Motion instructions (MoveJ / MoveL)
- Tool data configuration
- Work object definitions
- Tool exchange routines
- Conditional branching based on quality checks
- Phase-based execution logic
- Multi-robot task synchronization

The RAPID structure was designed to replicate realistic industrial programming practices and ensure operational validation within the simulated environment.

## Control Logic and Flow Design

A high-level control architecture was developed to define:

- Task sequencing between robots
- Quality verification stages
- Tool management logic
- Phase transitions within the production cycle
- Conditional process branching

The control flow ensures coherent multi-robot coordination and realistic industrial cycle execution.
